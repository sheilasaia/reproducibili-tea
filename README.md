1. Why [reproducibili-tea](https://reproducibilitea.org/)?
2. Real talk - Sweet Tea vs Unsweet Tea (which is better)

### Discussion
* Working towards being *as open as possible, where you improve with each iteration*
* Project directory structures - what to do with code and data?
* Example [Sheila's first reproducible repo](https://github.com/sheilasaia/paper-p-cycling-in-stream-biofilms)
* Example [Sheila's latest (work in progress) reproducible repo](https://github.com/sheilasaia/paper-ndfd-nccoast-study)

* Preprints in practice, for example, [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2545/)
* What happens when you can't be open? See [this preprint and appendix for ideas](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2288/)
